#🚌 Bus Tracking System

The Bus Tracking System is a web-based application designed to manage and monitor college/university bus operations in a structured and efficient way. The system provides separate dashboards for Students, Drivers, and Admins, enabling role-based access and functionality.

Students can view assigned bus and route details and check payment status placeholders. Drivers can update bus status manually, while admins can manage buses, routes, and users through a centralized dashboard.

This project uses a database-driven approach and does not implement real-time GPS tracking. Bus location and status updates are handled manually for academic and project-level feasibility.
